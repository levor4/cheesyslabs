<h2>Characters</h2>

<h3>Cheesy</h3>
<p>
  The main guy — once an experiment to achieve immortality. The scientists are all dead now... but Cheesy is still alive. <br>
  By being what? Yeaaa...<br>
  If you want to know more about Cheesy, <a href="mailto:youremail@example.com">send me an email</a>!
</p>

<h3>Stella</h3>
<p>
  Stella the Ice Cream. She and Cheesy were together... but broke up right before the chaos.<br>
  She can still see everything she's doing... but can't stop herself.<br>
  Want more about her? <a href="mailto:youremail@example.com">Email me</a> — just like with Cheesy.
</p>

<h3>+$(#?!#(:</h3>
<p>
  This character doesn’t have lore yet. All we know is... he’s an oven.<br>
  <a href="mailto:youremail@example.com">Email me your ideas</a> and maybe you’ll help shape his fate.
</p>

<h3>?????</h3>
<p>
  The unrevealed toon — soon to be revealed.<br>
  He’s based on a DW-style character but will get a design change later.<br>
  Keep your eyes open.
